                  The answer to this depends on what youd like to do with your career. If you would like to obtain a job in Cyber Security, a bachelors with a focus in Cyber Security will be your best bet. Some IT jobs can be obtained with certain qualifications, where for Software Engineer you can be self-taught and obtain a job.

                  Coding bootcamps are a good option to learn information of programming fast. While most employers recognize these camps as a good thing, bootcamps are not regionally or nationally accredited. Which means not every bootcamp will teach you as much as you would learn by obtaining a Computer Science degree. In today's job market, most individuals will be able to find a job after attending a bootcamp. Be aware of the up front cost though.
